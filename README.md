# Little Lemon Restaurant Table Booking Web App - Capstone Project

## Project Title: 
Little Lemon Restaurant Table Reservation System

## Description:
The Little Lemon Restaurant Table Reservation System is a web application built with **React** to allow customers to easily reserve tables at the restaurant. The web app provides an intuitive form for customers to select the date, time, number of diners, seating options, and add additional comments. After completing the reservation, customers receive a confirmation email, and the restaurant can manage bookings efficiently.

This project is the capstone project for the Front-End Developer course, where I applied front-end development skills learned throughout the course, including **React**, **UX/UI principles**, and **responsive web design**.

## Features:
- **Table Reservation Form**: Allows users to select the date, time, number of diners, seating preference, and add comments.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures users provide all required information before submitting.
- **Confirmation Email**: Sends a confirmation email after the reservation is completed.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility tags are applied to ensure a wide range of users can interact with the application.
- **Unit Testing**: The project includes unit tests to validate functionality.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: The primary framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the application and making it responsive.
- **Figma**: Used for designing wireframes and prototypes.
- **GitHub**: Version control and code repository.
